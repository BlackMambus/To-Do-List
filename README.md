# To-Do-List
This project is a console-based To-Do List application developed in C++. It allows users to manage daily tasks by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting to-do items. It demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts including file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), vectors, and user interaction via menus.

Features:
➕ Add Tasks – Create new to-do items with descriptions and optional priority.

📋 View Tasks – Display all tasks currently saved.

✏️ Edit Tasks – Modify existing task descriptions.

❌ Delete Tasks – Remove tasks by index or ID.

💾 Persistent Storage – Saves tasks to a file so data is not lost between runs.
